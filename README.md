# projectTech: Amore Dating App - Login/ register feature

In this repo I'm building my feature for a dating app called 'Amore'. Its for my project I had in my second year of my study Communication and Multimedia Design at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.

# Job story

"When I am using a dating app to look for a partner, I want to be able to register a profile and to login, so I always can come back and talk with my matches."

# Installation

# Usage
1. Run Developer Mode
```git $ npm run dev ```

2. Go to localhost:3000 in your browser and if everything has gone succesfull, you should see the feature.
